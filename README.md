## Reflections/Notes:
I have realized documenting security incidents is very important and that it ensures the correct steps can be taken to address the issue. Documentation can help identify was occurred and can minimize and prevent future incidents.
Exploring the many different cybersecurity tools and SIEM tools proves to me how important technology is in protecting networks, devices, and systems. Furthermore, tools make it much easier for cybersecurity professionals to do their jobs, and optimizing different tools properly can make completing tasks much more efficient.
